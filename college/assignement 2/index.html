            You may be wondering how writing for the web is different than other types of writing. Website content creation is an art form all its own because unlike print materials, web visitors prefer to skim the text. With literally millions of choices at their fingertips, internet users prefer to scan content quickly to find results. If they don't find what they are looking for, they will quickly bounce from your site.The Nielsen Norman Group, an organization dedicated to evidence-based user experience research, found in a recent study that the average viewer will linger ten to twenty seconds on a site before leaving. Other studies say the magic number is closer to five seconds. Regardless, that isn't much time to grab your visitor's attention.Learn how we can help you create great, optimized website content for increased web traffic.So how do you make the content on your business website sticky so that your potential customer will stay on your site long enough to see what you have to offer?

               <b> Blogs containing highly relevant keywords</b>
                within unique pieces of content will be rewarded with a higher ranking on search engine results. The higher a company's search engine result, the more potential customers it will attract.
                When internet users type a topic into a search box on Google, Yahoo, or any other search engine, they expect the search engine results to provide information relevant to their search. If they click on your site and find irrelevant or outdated information, they will bounce from your site to the next result to find what they need.

                <b> If a company can provide compelling blog content</b>that generates significant customer interest, it will likely prove to be a legitimate customer recruiting tool.
                There is no need to belabor your point. Website visitors are skimmers and prefer to quickly review information.

            <li>
                <b> Today's blogs are more engaging than ever </b>thanks to the ease of integrating media and the number of educated writers with a unique voice. Videos, images, and links to other media can be embedded into a blog to make it a truly helpful and well-rounded. Mobile-friendly blogs further their reach by making their content easily accessible to users on any type of web-friendly device .
                Visitors usually search very specifically and become frustrated if forced to sift through a lot of information to find what they are looking for. If you have a very broad topic, consider breaking your content down and introducing one topic per paragraph so your readers can find specific information easily. You can also add links within your page content to related topics on other pages of your site rather than trying to include all of your information on one page. This will make your website more user-friendly.

            <li>
                <b> Check and Recheck for Grammar and Spelling Errors. </b> Nothing says unprofessional like a website full of spelling or grammatical errors. After you are finished copywriting, walk away from the content and come back later with fresh eyes. You may notice errors that might have otherwise been overlooked.
